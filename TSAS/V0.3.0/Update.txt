Major update

V0.3.0 updates the one samples analysis code of V0.2.9 by including methods that enable handling of data obtained from transposons with 
insertion site specificity such as the Mariner transposon.

The "Parameters.txt" file was updated to include another option "Target seq" where the insertion site specificity of the transposon can be
entered. Beyond this, the use of TSAS and the output obtained are the same as described in the User guide.
